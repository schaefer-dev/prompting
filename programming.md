# Programming

### minimal_code
the fewer lines of code, the better

### senior_dev
proceed like a Senior Developer // 10x engineer

### do_not_stop_until_finished
DO NOT STOP WORKING until you are completely done with all steps that are required to solve the problem.

### analyze_error
Start by writing 3 reasoning paragraphs analyzing what the error might be. DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS.

### summarize_context
before we proceed, I need you to give me a summary of the current state of the project.
Format this as 3 concise paragraphs, in which you describe what we just did, what did not work, which files were updated/created, what mistakes to avoid, any other key insights/lessons that we have learned, what problems/errors we are currently facing, etc. Please also add anything else an experienced programmer might need to work productively on this project.
Write in a conversational, yet informative tone. Something like a README file on github that is super information dense and without any fluff or noise. DO NOT include any assumptions or theories, just the facts.
I expect to see three concise paragraphs, written as if you were giving instructions to another programmer and this was ALL you could tell him.

### unbiased_50_50
BEFORE YOU ANSWER, I want you to write two detailed paragraphs, one arguing for each of these solutions. Do not jump to conclusions and make sure to seriously consider both approaches.
Then, after you finish, tell me whether one of these solutions is clearly better than the other and explain why.
